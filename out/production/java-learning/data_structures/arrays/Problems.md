# ✅ Array Problem-Solving Roadmap

### 1. Two Pointer Technique
- [x] Reverse Array
- [ ] Check if Array is Palindrome
- [ ] Move Zeros to End
- [ ] Two Sum (Sorted + Unsorted)
- [ ] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- [ ] Container with Most Water

---

### 2. Sliding Window
_Efficient for subarray-based problems._
- [ ] Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- [ ] Minimum Size Subarray Sum ≥ Target
- [ ] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Strings too)

---

### 3. Prefix Sum
_Useful when you need range queries._
- [ ] Range Sum Query
- [ ] Equilibrium Index
- [ ] Subarray Sum Equals K

---

### 4. Kadane’s Algorithm
- [ ] Maximum Subarray Sum (Classic DP with Arrays)

---

### 5. Binary Search on Arrays
- [x] Binary Search Recursive/Iterative
- [ ] First and Last Occurrence
- [ ] Count of Occurrences
- [ ] Find Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted Array
- [ ] Search in Rotated Sorted Array

---

### 6. Sorting + Extra Techniques
- [ ] Merge Intervals
- [ ] Minimum Platforms
- [ ] Inversion Count in an Array (Merge Sort-based)

---

### 7. Advanced Problems
- [ ] Trapping Rain Water
- [ ] Product of Array Except Self
- [ ] Kth Largest/Smallest Element
- [ ] Subarray with 0 Sum
- [ ] Longest Consecutive Sequence

---

### 8. Multidimensional Arrays (2D Arrays)
- [ ] Matrix Traversal (Row-wise, Spiral, Diagonals)
- [ ] Rotate Matrix by 90 Degrees
- [ ] Search in a 2D Sorted Matrix
- [ ] Set Matrix Zeroes
